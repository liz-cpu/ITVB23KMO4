    "> As discussed in the lecture: a farmer has a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. He must transport himself and both animals, along with the cabbage, to the other side of the river. There is a small boat in which he can carry only one thing at a time. However, if the wolf and the goat are left alone, the wolf will eat the goat. If the goat and the cabbage are left alone, the goat will eat the cabbage. \n",

    "> Here are some hints: a state represents the configuration of the left and right banks. For example, 'FGCW|' is the initial state, and '|FGCW' is the final state. A state can transition to the next state as the farmer crosses the river with an item. If we view the states as nodes and the transitions as branches, we get a tree structure that we can explore with depth-first search (DFS). Refer to the lecture slides for more details.\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, I created a class called `Node` which represents the state of the river. It has the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `top`: a set of characters representing items on the top side of the river. This is also the initial side.\n",
    "- `bottom`: a set of characters representing items on the bottom side of the river. This is also the final side.\n",
    "- `farmer`: a boolean value indicating whether the boat is on the top side or not.\n",
    "- `parent`: the parent state of the current state. This is used to trace back the path from the final state to the initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to compare two states, I implemented the `__eq__` method. It returns `True` if the two states (top, bottom, farmer's side) are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `move` method is used to move an item from one side to the other. It takes an item as an argument and returns a new state. If the item is not on the same side as the boat, it returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`is_valid` was somehow the hardest method to implement. It checks if the state is valid or not. A state is valid if on the side where the farmer is not,\n",
    "no item is eaten. The `prohibited = [set(\"🐐🥬\"), set(\"🐐🐺\")]` variable contains the combinations of items that are not allowed to be on the same side.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_children` method returns a list of valid states that can be reached from the current state. It does so by calling the `move` method for each item on the current side and adds this to the list **and** a child node for the farmer without any item."
