    "> - Finding 'brackets' (given a position, a player, and a direction): given a position, what is the corresponding position that encloses a row of the opponent's stones?\n",

The stability of a piece is determined by how many pieces it is adjacent to. The more pieces it is adjacent to, the more stable it is.

    "#### Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alpha–beta pruning** is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player combinatorial games (Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Connect 4, etc.). It stops evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse than a previously examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.
